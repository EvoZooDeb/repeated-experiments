# repeated-experiments

an R code to create a list of samples of categories for experiments.

For example you play sounds and you have 4 categories: Cuckoo1, Cuckoo-2, Cuckoo-3, Dove
and you would like to perform 16 experiments where the order of sounds is random.
You can make this random ordered category list with this code. 
Each categories will be represented equally.

cheers :)



Further plans:

  create a function... package?
